# 09. Boolean Algebra and Applications

---

## What is Boolean Algebra?

Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with variables having two possible values: true/false or 1/0. It forms the basis for digital logic circuits and computer architecture.

---

## Boolean Operations

- **AND (·):** True if both inputs are true.
- **OR (+):** True if at least one input is true.
- **NOT (¬):** Inverts the value.

---

## Laws of Boolean Algebra

- **Commutative:** A+B = B+A ; AB = BA
- **Associative:** (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)
- **Distributive:** A(B+C) = AB+AC
- **Identity:** A+0 = A ; A·1 = A
- **Null Law:** A+1 = 1 ; A·0 = 0
- **Idempotent:** A+A = A ; A·A = A
- **Inverse:** A+¬A = 1 ; A·¬A = 0
- **Absorption:** A+AB = A ; A(A+B) = A
- **DeMorgan’s Laws:** ¬(A·B) = ¬A+¬B ; ¬(A+B) = ¬A·¬B

---

## Canonical Forms

- **Sum of Products (SOP):** OR of ANDs.
- **Product of Sums (POS):** AND of ORs.

---

## Minimization

- Use Boolean laws and Karnaugh Maps (K-maps) to simplify expressions.
- Reduces the number of gates in hardware.

---

## Applications in Computer Science

- **Logic Circuits:** Design of digital devices (adders, multiplexers, memory).
- **Switching Circuits:** Implementation of complex switching functions.
- **Computer Arithmetic:** Circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication.
- **Databases:** Query optimization using Boolean expressions.
- **Search Engines:** Boolean queries for document retrieval.

---

## Logic Gates

- Hardware implementation of Boolean functions.
- Types: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.

---

## Boolean Functions

- Functions mapping binary variables to binary outputs.
- Any logic circuit can be described by a Boolean function.

---

## Real-World Applications

- Digital electronics (processors, memory)
- Control systems (industrial automation)
- Networking (routing, packet switching)
- Software (conditional statements, logic in programming)

---

## Interview Patterns

- Minimize Boolean expressions using laws and K-maps.
- Implement logic circuits from Boolean equations.
- Translate real-world logic into Boolean expressions.
- Prove equivalence of two Boolean expressions.
