## What is Discrete Mathematics?

**Discrete Mathematics** deals with mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It includes topics such as logic, sets, relations, combinatorics, graph theory, and algorithmic thinking.

## Importance in Computer Science

- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Discrete math provides the foundation for designing and analyzing algorithms and data structures.
- **Logic and Computation:** Understanding logical reasoning is critical for programming, automated proof, and hardware design.
- **Cryptography:** Relies on number theory, combinatorics, and discrete structures.
- **Network Theory:** Graphs model computer networks, social networks, and more.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Uses logic, probability, and combinatorics.
