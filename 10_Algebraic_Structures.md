# 10. Algebraic Structures: Groups, Rings, and Fields

---

## What are Algebraic Structures?

Algebraic structures are sets equipped with operations (like addition, multiplication) that satisfy certain axioms. They provide a framework for understanding symmetry, computation, and cryptography.

## Groups

### Definition

A **group** is a set G with a binary operation * such that:

1. **Closure:** a * b ∈ G for all a, b ∈ G.
2. **Associativity:** (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).
3. **Identity:** There exists e ∈ G such that a * e = e * a = a, ∀ a ∈ G.
4. **Inverse:** For every a ∈ G, ∃ b ∈ G such that a * b = b * a = e.

### Types

- **Abelian Group:** Commutative (a * b = b * a).
- **Cyclic Group:** Generated by repeated operation on a single element.

---

## Rings

### Definition

A **ring** is a set R with two binary operations (+, ·):

1. (R, +) is an abelian group.
2. (R, ·) is closed and associative.
3. Distributive: a·(b + c) = a·b + a·c

### Types

- **Commutative Ring:** ab = ba.
- **Ring with Unity:** Has a multiplicative identity.

---

## Fields

### Definition

A **field** is a commutative ring where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

### Examples

- Rational, real, complex numbers (Q, R, C)
- Finite fields (GF(p) for prime p)

---

## Substructures

- **Subgroup:** Subset that is a group.
- **Subring:** Subset that is a ring.
- **Subfield:** Subset that is a field.

---

## Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms

- **Homomorphism:** Structure-preserving map between structures.
- **Isomorphism:** Bijective homomorphism (structures are “the same” algebraically).

---

## Applications

- Cryptography (finite fields, groups)
- Coding theory (error correction)
- Computer algebra systems
- Abstract algebra in algorithms

---

## Examples

- (Z, +) is an abelian group.
- (Z, +, ·) is a ring, but not a field.
- (Q, +, ·) is a field.

---

## Interview Patterns

- Prove a set with an operation is a group/ring/field.
- Find subgroups/subrings in given sets.
- Use group theory in cryptography problems.

---

## Exercises

1. Prove (Z, +) is a group, but (Z, ·) is not.
2. Show that (2Z, +) is a subgroup of (Z, +).
3. Is (Z₆, +, ·) a field? Why or why not?
4. List all subgroups of (Z₄, +).
5. Define a homomorphism between (Z, +) and (Z₅, +).
