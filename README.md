## üöÄ How to Use This Guide

- **Learn sequentially:** Each section builds a foundation for the next. Progress from basics (sets, logic) to advanced topics (graphs, probability).
- **Practice actively:** Attempt every exercise, draw diagrams, and write your own proofs.
- **Quick revision:** Use for last-minute review before exams or interviews.
- **Explore references:** Every section ends with trusted reference links for deeper learning and practical examples.
