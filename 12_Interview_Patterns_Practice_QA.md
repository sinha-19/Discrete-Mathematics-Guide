# 12. Interview Patterns, Practice, and Q&A

---

## Interview Patterns

1. **Sets, Relations, Functions**
    - Prove properties of relations (reflexive, symmetric, transitive).
    - Identify and apply one-to-one, onto, bijective functions.
    - Draw and interpret Venn diagrams.

2. **Logic and Proofs**
    - Construct truth tables and identify tautologies.
    - Translate statements to predicate logic.
    - Use induction and contradiction to prove results.

3. **Combinatorics**
    - Count arrangements and selections.
    - Apply pigeonhole principle and inclusion-exclusion.

4. **Recurrences and Generating Functions**
    - Solve linear recurrences.
    - Use generating functions for closed-form solutions.

5. **Graphs and Trees**
    - Traverse graphs (BFS, DFS), find connected components.
    - Construct and traverse trees, analyze properties.

6. **Boolean Algebra**
    - Minimize logic expressions.
    - Model real-world problems with Boolean equations.

7. **Algebraic Structures**
    - Prove group/ring/field properties.
    - Apply isomorphisms and homomorphisms.

8. **Probability**
    - Calculate event probabilities, expectations.
    - Solve conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem problems.
